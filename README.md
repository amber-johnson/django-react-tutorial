# A Todo List using Django and React JS

## From the tutorial
This project was created following the tutorial outlined [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react). 
While the original code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/do-community/django-todo-react), instead of forking it, I wanted to walk through the steps to ensure I understood the backend and frontend relationship and the software dependencies.

This Todo app can be run locally following the steps [in the tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/build-a-to-do-application-using-django-and-react).  Once running, it provides a button to add a task.  The task includes a title and a description.  There is a checkbox to mark if the task is completed.  After saving a task, completed tasks appear under the Complete tab while unchecked tasks appear under the Incomplete tab.  Created tasks have buttons to Edit or Delete tasks.
